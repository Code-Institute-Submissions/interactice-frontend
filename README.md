## Deployment

The version control and deployment of this project is based on Git Hub. After every session I push the local code within Cloud9 into my GIT HUB repository.

This is my procedure: 

After I have finished working on the files in my IDE I would open the terminal and do the following commands to push the updated files across to the repository on GitHub

``` $git add . ```

```$git commit -m "describe the stage I am at"```

```git push -u origin master```

I would now ```$git status``` to check if everything is finished and then look at the repository to see there aswell.
